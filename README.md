# Planaria-modelling
UFBA planaria modelling for 3D printing and molding

Planarians are a type of flatworm that can be found in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial environments. In this project, we were most interested by the locomotion of planarians in water. My main contribution to studying this biolocomotion was in designing 3D-printable molds to form shapes that may recreate this motion.

You will find in this repository the python codes written to model any surface in 3 dimension and also some that model Enneper surfaces. I also added the stl files that were used for the 3d printing. It is important to note that to use the python files you need to adapt the file path at the end of the script to your computer.
